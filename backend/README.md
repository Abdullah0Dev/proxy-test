I need to connect them to each other
Backend and the webb app

<!-- 
* => user proxies implements
get the the email/username from the client -> then make a mongodb data base for this specific user which is gonna be with listing his own bought proxies with its data.. and make expire data.. then it deleted automatticly -> then he need to renew the proxy

* => finding the proxy that are not rented..
if a proxy is not associated with a client so it's gonna be available.. if not it's already in use (in admin side brief)

* => question related to: find the free proxy and make it for users that wanna buy.. and display it on their dashboard.. (in admin side brief)
1. do you wanna change the current view in the dashboard.. and make it when the user add a new proxy and configure the setting like that country that he needs and so on.. he see all the available proxy for sale... and he choose one of them and checkout?

الحمد لله اخيرا قدرت اشوفها دلوقت:
تمام اوي كدا بس فيه بعض التعديلات:
1. in port section you forgot to add SOCKS and you just added http
2. remove the country or comment its code for now, cuz the client said am just targeting Netherlands
3. in UserName:Password you got the wrong name:password instead it should be: *abdullah:server1* , *nokta:proxy* and so on instead of these amount of string
4. are the ended time are hard code? I already include its data
5. what is the ping states? could you please tell me cuz I can't remember
6. the buttons are not working... and I already provided all of their functionality or you didn't worked on it yet.. -> also the download proxy button I end it in the backend and gonna deploy the route for it
7. could you please add: 'CELLOP' from the data which is 'Vodafone L, and Odido' and others...
